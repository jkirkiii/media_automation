### üü° HIGH PRIORITY: Files Still in Nested Folders (56 files)

- **Season 05:** 8 episodes still in nested folders
- **Season 06:** 10 episodes still in nested folders
- **Season 07:** 10 episodes still in nested folders
- **Season 08:** 4 episodes still in nested folders
- **Season 09:** 4 episodes still in nested folders

**Current Structure Example:**
```
Taskmaster (2015)/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Season 02/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Taskmaster.S02E01.WEB.x264-C4TV[rarbg]/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Taskmaster - S02E01 - Fear of Failure.mkv  ‚ùå NESTED

#### 1. Wild Wild Country (2018)
**Current Structure:**
```
Wild Wild Country (2018)/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wild.Wild.Country.S01E01.WEB.x264-AMRAP[ettv]/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [episode file]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wild.Wild.Country.S01E02.WEB.x264-AMRAP[ettv]/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [episode file]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (6 episodes)
```
