- **Series Folders:** `{Series Title} ({Series Year})`

### Automation Behavior
Based on PROJECT_CONFIGURATION.md preferences:

**For Monitored Shows:**
- Auto-download new episodes immediately when released
- Prefer 1080p WEB-DL quality
- Auto-upgrade propers/repacks
- Include specials
- Download immediately (don't wait for Bluray)

**For Existing Library:**
- Keep what you have (don't re-download)
- Only get new episodes going forward
- Respect conservative upgrade strategy

**Seeding:**
- Files remain in qBittorrent after import
- Manual removal after meeting 10-day/ratio requirements
- Downloads stored in: A:\Downloads\Complete
- Media files copied to: A:\Media\TV Shows\

## Upcoming Episodes (Next 7 Days)

Sonarr detected 4 upcoming episodes that will auto-download:
- 10/29 17:00 - S49E06
- 10/29 17:30 - S05E05
- 10/30 00:00 - S02E02
- 10/30 14:00 - S20E08

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Workflow

1. **RSS Monitoring:**
   - Sonarr checks indexers every 60 minutes for new releases
   - Monitors calendar for upcoming episode air dates

2. **Search & Grab:**
   - When episode airs, searches all 3 indexers
   - Selects best quality match (1080p WEB-DL preferred)
   - Sends to qBittorrent with tv-sonarr category

3. **Download:**
   - qBittorrent downloads to A:\Downloads\Incomplete
   - Moves to A:\Downloads\Complete when done
   - Continues seeding

4. **Import:**
   - Sonarr detects completed download
   - Renames per naming format
   - Copies to A:\Media\TV Shows\[Show]\[Season]\
   - Original stays in downloads for seeding
   - Updates Sonarr status to "Downloaded"

5. **Cleanup:**
   - You manually remove from qBittorrent after seed requirements met
   - Periodically clean A:\Downloads\Complete
